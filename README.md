# Cold Waters 1962
Cold Waters 1962 is an addon for DotMod that aims to add 1962-based content along with a '62 NATO campaign.

Using the existing 1968 NATO campaign as a base, I have crafted different introductory events, removed some vessels and weapons that were not in use at the time and added some period-specific replacements.

Requires at least DotMod v0.4a-2.

## New Vessels
#### Soviet Union
* Whiskey-class "Twin Cylinder" SSG
* Hotel II-class SSBN

## New Weapons
#### Soviet Union
* 53-61 Torpedo
* SAET-60 Torpedo
* SET-53 Torpedo
* SS-N-3c Shaddock Missile

## Installation
1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, add the mod to your MODS folder and activate through JSGME.exe.
   
_Note:_ if you don't use JSGME, you can just copy the mod's content into your Cold Waters installation directory as the content matches the folder structure.

## Notes
* To ensure there is minimal impact to your installation of Cold Waters, I'd advise you to apply the mod to a fresh install of Cold Waters with DotMod v0.4a-2.
* The mod will add to Cold Waters a '62 NATO campaign as the sixth campaign - this may affect any custom campaigns you have set-up in your installation of the game.
