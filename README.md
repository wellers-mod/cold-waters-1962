# Cold Waters 1962
Cold Waters 1962 is an addon for DotMod that aims to add 1962-based content along with a '62 NATO campaign.

Using the existing 1968 NATO campaign as a base, I have crafted different introductory events, removed some vessels and weapons that were not in use at the time and created some period-specific replacements.

Requires at least DotMod v0.4a-2.

## New Vessels
#### United States
* Tang-class SSK
* Grayback-class SSG
* Seawolf-class SSN
* Skate-class SSN
* Halibut-class SSGN

#### Soviet Union
* Quebec-class SS
* Whiskey-class "Twin Cylinder" SSG
* Hotel II-class SSBN

## New Weapons
#### United States
* SSM-N-8 Regulus Missile
* SSM-N-9 Regulus II Missile

#### Soviet Union
* 53-61 Torpedo
* SAET-60 Torpedo
* SET-53 Torpedo
* SS-N-3c Shaddock Missile

## Installation
1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) Download the latest version of the mod from [Releases](https://github.com/wellers/cold-waters-1962/releases)
3) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, unzipped the contents of the downloaded zip into the "MODS" folder - this usually resides under your Cold Waters installation directory.
4) Open JSGME. The addon should appear under "Available Mods". 
5) Activate the mod.
   
_Note:_ if you don't want to install the mod using JSGME, you can just copy the mod's "ColdWaters_Data" folder into your Cold Waters installation directory - the content matches the folder structure.

## Notes
* To ensure there is minimal impact to your installation of Cold Waters, I'd advise you to apply the mod to a fresh install of Cold Waters with DotMod v0.4a-2.
* The mod will add to Cold Waters a '62 NATO campaign as the sixth campaign - this may affect any custom campaigns you have set-up in your installation of the game.
