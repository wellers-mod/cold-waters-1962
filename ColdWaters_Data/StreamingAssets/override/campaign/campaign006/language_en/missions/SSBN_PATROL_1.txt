[ORDERS]
1.	(S) TACTICAL SITUATION:
HIGHLY PLACED INTELLIGENCE SOURCES INDICATE THAT THE SOVIETS INTEND TO MOVE A BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE TO A POSITION CLOSE TO THE EASTERN U.S. COAST, VIA THE DENMARK STRAIT. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS DEPLOYMENT WOULD GIVE RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP THE OPTION OF A SHORT-NOTICE, DEPRESSED-TRAJECTORY ATTACK ON US COMMAND AND CONTROL INSTALLATIONS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE CHANCES OF A SUCCESSFUL NUCLEAR FIRST STRIKE. IF YOU FAIL THIS MISSION, YOU MAY NOT HAVE A HOME BASE TO RETURN TO. BE ADVISED ENEMY BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE LIKELY ESCORTED BY ONE OR MORE ATTACK SUBMARINES, BUT THE PRESENCE OF A SURFACE ESCORT IS UNLIKELY.


2.	(S) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
TRANSIT TO AND PATROL AREA **GREEN 312** NORTH OF ICELAND. LOCATE AND SINK THE ENEMY BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE.

3.	(S) SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:
DESTROY THE SSG AT ALL COSTS.

4.	(S) AVOID DETECTION BY ENEMY ASW PATROLS

5.	(S) ROE: WARNING YELLOW, WEAPONS FREE ON DESIGNATED TARGETS

6.	(S) EMCON - MAINTAIN RADIO SILENCE UNTIL OTHERWISE DIRECTED
